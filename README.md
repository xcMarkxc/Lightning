# Lightning
"Lightning" is an ultra-fast (150–200 km/h) FPV drone designed specifically for filming car races, motorsport events, and high-speed action. The goal isn’t to break speed records, it’s to build a stable, reliable, user-friendly, and professionally capable chase drone that can keep up with racing cars while delivering smooth cinematic footage.
