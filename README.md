# Lightning
"Lightning" is an ultra-fast (150–200 km/h) FPV drone designed specifically for filming car races, motorsport events, and high-speed action. The goal isn’t to break speed records, it’s to build a stable, reliable, user-friendly, and professionally capable chase drone that can keep up with racing cars while delivering smooth cinematic footage.

This drone will be used to film motosport events, team promos, ads, livestreams, and social-media content.
Eventually, the project will grow into a sellable, production-ready product startup.

I’ve been building and flying FPV drones for several years, and I have experience with 3D printing, Betaflight configuration, PCB design and electronics like Arduino and ESP32. I regularly film commercial FPV footage, including real-estate and promo videos. My goal is to combine my engineering skills with my FPV experience to build a drone capable of filming motorsport events at professional quality.
